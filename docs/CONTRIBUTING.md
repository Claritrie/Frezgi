## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Frezgi.git`
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser
- A text editor or IDE
- Git for version control
- Node LTS v22.16.0


### Local Development
Since Frezgi is a static Vue.js application:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Claritrie/Frezgi.git
   cd Frezgi
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server:
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Node.js
   npx http-server

   # PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to see the application


### Developer Setup

- install dependencies `npm ci` **NB** If you have a Macbook with the M Chip set please run the following script after installation `npm run mac-arm:setup`,
- install system specific libraries for playwright with `npm run playwright-setup`
- create an `.env` in the `Vue` directory and copy the values from .env.template. You can use `https://www.frezgi.com` as the URL if you wish
- run the dev server while watching for changes for `npm run dev`
- run tests with `npm run test`

> Note: A _run_tests.sh has been provided to automate this setup but that's up to you. If you don't care about your current envs, use `echo -e "y\ny" | sh _run_tests.sh` (answering yes to both prompts) **at your own risk**.

## How to Contribute

### Branch Naming Convention
Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/add-export-functionality`
- `fix/node-dragging-bug`
- `docs/update-readme`
- `refactor/simplify-color-system`

### Workflow (GitHub Flow)
We use **GitHub Flow** - a simple, branch-based workflow that's perfect for open source projects:

#### Why GitHub Flow?
- **Simple**: Only one main branch + feature branches
- **Fast**: No complex branch hierarchies to navigate
- **Contributor-friendly**: Easy for new contributors to understand
- **Continuous deployment**: Perfect for web applications like Frezgi
- **Industry standard**: Used by most successful open source projects

#### The Process:
1. **Create a branch** from `main` for your feature/fix
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make commits** with clear, descriptive messages
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add export functionality for argument tries"
   ```

3. **Push and open a Pull Request** early for discussion
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Iterate** based on feedback and reviews

5. **Merge** when approved and all checks pass

#### Branch Protection
- `main` branch is protected and always deployable
- **Only project admins/maintainers can commit directly to `main`**
- **All contributors must use Pull Requests** - no exceptions
- At least one review required before merging
- No direct pushes to `main` allowed for contributors
- Automated checks must pass before merging
